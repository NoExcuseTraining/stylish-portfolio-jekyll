                    <p class="review-text">I have been running and training with Jess for 3 years. Jess is focused on helping me achieve my goals and her attention to, and correction of, my running form has helped me tremendously. Every session is
                        challenging and I have been able to see continual improvement in my running, my confidence level and my overall health. Jess has a vast knowledge of her profession, and her motivation and encouragement are the reasons I leave
                        each session feeling exhilarated and looking forward to returning. I highly recommend Jess as a running coach and personal trainer.</p>

                    <p class="review-text">I have known Jessica for over 10 years now. Last year I finally took the initiative to hire her as my personal trainer. It has been by far one of the best things I’ve ever done for myself. I had always been
                        active, doing races, triathlons, and so on. However, about 3-4 years had past and I lost my way. Fast forward to today. It’s been a year and I’ve lost 10 lbs and 15 inches. I finally feel fit again, and ready to take on
                        anything. Jessica is very caring, but at the same time takes no bull if you know what I mean. No excuses means exactly that. I highly recommend Jessica to anyone who wants to move out of their comfort zone and up their game
                        on any level.</p>

                    <p class="review-text">Jessica is the best! Before I started going to Jessica, I was in constant pain from my scoliosis. Doctors and physical therapists advised me to exercise, but I found it difficult to find workouts that were
                        right for me. Jessica understands my goals and tailors each workout specifically to target my concerns. Every week the workout is different, so I'm never bored! I feel so much stronger now and can't believe how much better I
                        feel!</p>
