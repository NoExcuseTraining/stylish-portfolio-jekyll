                        Jess was a varsity high school athlete where she played field hockey (all-county), basketball and ran track for all 4 years.  In college she played rugby and continued to run and strength train as a way to stay fit and relieve stress.  This love for fitness propelled her to become a personal trainer/run coach where she has coached/trained one to one, small group and online for all ages and abilities.  From aspiring Olympic competitors who need to improve their running times to individuals who want to run their first running race, she has worked with a wide ranging clientele. She hopes to take all of her knowledge and experience to help individuals to reach their full potential.
